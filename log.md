# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30th 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Created a Github account, created a profile on freecode camp and completed 30% of the Responsive web design course. 

**Thoughts:** I have had an idea for a H&S website for a while, so I am going to use this as a goal to assist in my learning of HTML & Javascript. I obtained a link to the digital versions of YDNJS series. So far so good. 


### Day 1: January 2nd 2021

Worked on a project website for H&S question and answer. Attempted to mimic the HTML requirements form the respnsive web development course with random sucess, need to learn baout formatting & layout. There were a few issues in the first revision with radio types instead of checkboxes.  

**Thoughts**: Looking back through the coe after a day of not working on it makes it difficult to interpret the work. I am sure clarity will ocme with time. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 2: January 4th Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, along with integrating the learnt CSS & HTML works onto my SHEQ project. Learnt about style blocks, github projects and assigning classes. Researched into the use of commas and apostraphes, along with buying HTML & CSS design by Jon Duckett. 

**Thoughts** Great fun when working through bugs, or errors, learning how to use google and stack overflow is helping, along with watching some intro videos to CSS, HTML5 and github has helped progression. 

Things to research: ODIN project, Colt Steeles course, you don't know JS, Havard CS50.

### Day 3: January 6th Thursday.
Started listening to HTML series online. Continued with freecode camp. Learnt abouty using CSS to style boxes, padding, mrgins and using clockwork form to dictate top, right, bottom and left sizes. Trying to keep a seprate log on the individual elements and classes, but having discovered WS3Schools and other web resoruces it may prove more difficult to remember, so googling may be the way foward.
