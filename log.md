# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30th 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Created a Github account, created a profile on freecode camp and completed 30% of the Responsive web design course. 

**Thoughts:** I have had an idea for a H&S website for a while, so I am going to use this as a goal to assist in my learning of HTML & Javascript. I obtained a link to the digital versions of YDNJS series. So far so good. 


### Day 1: January 2nd 2021

Worked on a project website for H&S question and answer. Attempted to mimic the HTML requirements form the respnsive web development course with random sucess, need to learn baout formatting & layout. There were a few issues in the first revision with radio types instead of checkboxes.  

**Thoughts**: Looking back through the coe after a day of not working on it makes it difficult to interpret the work. I am sure clarity will ocme with time. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 2: January 4th Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, along with integrating the learnt CSS & HTML works onto my SHEQ project. Learnt about style blocks, github projects and assigning classes. Researched into the use of commas and apostraphes, along with buying HTML & CSS design by Jon Duckett. 

**Thoughts** Great fun when working through bugs, or errors, learning how to use google and stack overflow is helping, along with watching some intro videos to CSS, HTML5 and github has helped progression. 

Things to research: ODIN project, Colt Steeles course, you don't know JS, Havard CS50.

### Day 3: January 6th Thursday.
Started listening to HTML series online. Continued with freecode camp. Learnt abouty using CSS to style boxes, padding, mrgins and using clockwork form to dictate top, right, bottom and left sizes. Trying to keep a seprate log on the individual elements and classes, but having discovered WS3Schools and other web resoruces it may prove more difficult to remember, so googling may be the way foward. 

CSS Lengths: can be absoloute such as inchs,mm, metres, or relative such as .em, or .rem. em & rem are relative units and therefore relative to fot sizes etc. 
Using the # signifies an element with a specific ID attribute, where as (.) signifiesa and element with a specific class attribute. 

### Day 4: January 8th Thursday.

Continued with free code camp, learnt about using CSS variables and custom variables and how the :root: function allows cascading.inheitance of attributes and takes priority above the body class. 
Also learnt was the use of ID''s to override certain CSS assignments along with using in-line styles. The use of RGB and Hex colours in CSS to give a bigger range of formatting colours. Also learnt about the use of assigning cutom variables to styles and elements. 

### Day 5: January 17th Monday 

Book from Jon Duckett came, reading into beginning of HTML and CSS. Including how to uise and arrange file structures within webpages. Also learnt was the use of building web pages in macs and how HTML works when working with websites such as wordpress and word documents. Also delve more deeply into using Aref's to navigate along pages. 
- Freecode camp is now onto applied visual Design, currently building the director on Github for the SHEQ website Q&A including a seperate page for questions already asked. 
- Looking in applied visual design and using properties to assign visual affects. Must remmeber that the (#) is for assigning properties. 


## Day 6: January 18th Tuesday. 
Began using "font-size and Font-weight properties with CSS. This can be used to aid in styling design for your webpage by adding in CSS to the html elements. 
Begin with Harvard CS:50. 
Introduction to using Psuedo-elements such as ":hover". 
Also learnng is about CSS Box model and containers, "Relative" means that you are moving an item relative to it's position on the normal flow of a page. This is contrary to absoloute, which locks an item to a fixed position and ccauses other items to ignore it and the space it fills. 
Also looked at was fixed positioning and how items can be fixed relative to it's parent's position. 

## Day 7 January 19th 
Applied web design and learning about display: block and in-line block elements, also learning about HSL and it's use for colour web design. Alos looked at was adding in Z-index to div elements to create the layering effect, the higher the Z number the further along the Z-axis it becomes. Learnt was using the Margin: auto; to center objects horizontaly on the webpage. 

## Day 8 January 20th
Day 8 begins with thelinear-repeating-gradiant(), where the gradient beginnings are written as the amount of pixels away from the start of the gradient. Also used was the use of psueod elements such as :hover, when used with eleemnts such as (div) and links. Using the Transform fuinction, along with the skew(X,Y,Z) for page design. 
Also shown was the use of background textures and patterns to aid in the visual layout ofd the site. 


## Day 9 Febuary 5th 
Day 9 begins after a two week break. Decided to spend some time renewing the SHEQ website with stuff learnt over the past couple of weeks rather than trying to burn myself out by hammering home freecodecamp.

## Day 10 Febuary 6th
Decided to add a navigation bar to the top of the SHEQ website, found out that using @import is now frowened upon so stopped attempting to make it work. Aftert he Nav bar isifnishedi  nthe demo HTML ill add the styles to a seperate CSS sheet to tdiy everything up. Currently using elements of freecodecamp such as creating links insides unordered lists to create a nvigation bar, along with using fixed positioning for the header. following https://codetheweb.blog/style-a-navigation-bar-css/

I asked a question on stack overflow and got some...heated responses, soft skills seem to be lacking in the developer world. I need to better utilise more up to date functions,and ensure that before using free-code-camp soloutions, to check if their are more up to date, or common methods.  

## Day 11 Febuary 7th 
Decided to carry on with freecode camp, although i still want to get a better grasp of CSS where possible. Before carrying on with freecode camp i want to get the DIV background width =100% and center the wording and submission form. Decided against the background color as it did not look right. 

Almost completed the Visual design element to Freecode camp and I am looking foward to getting started with the javascript element. I still want to get a good handle on CSS abd the underlying code and reasoning, but unsure of how to begin. The last elements are to do with UI design andf layout and @keyframes. 

## Day 12 Febuary 8th 

Today is focused on applied accessibility for user interfaces and how screen readers process information. Also instilled is the need to use the <hx> tags not for sizing, but for actual layout of the webpage and the flow, and to indicatet hier rank, not to automatically decide on sizings for you. You should aim to use CSS for this. 
  
   main, header, footer, nav, article, and section are all new HTML tags for HTML5
  Article = forum posts, news articles, and standalone content from the background webpages. 
  Section = Grouping thematically linked content together.
  
  <form>  
  <label for="name">Name:</label> ------------------> The "label for" value, must be equal to the ID of the element. 
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>
Also must remmeber HTML5 tags are <></> atrtributes sit inside tags, values are well values.
  
When looking into website accessibility, it is important to think about all aspects from colorblindess to just keyboard users for instancem, <div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div> can be used to rank tabs and priority.
