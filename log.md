# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30th 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Created a Github account, created a profile on freecode camp and completed 30% of the Responsive web design course. 

**Thoughts:** I have had an idea for a H&S website for a while, so I am going to use this as a goal to assist in my learning of HTML & Javascript. I obtained a link to the digital versions of YDNJS series. So far so good. 


### Day 1: January 2nd 2021

Worked on a project website for H&S question and answer. Attempted to mimic the HTML requirements form the respnsive web development course with random sucess, need to learn baout formatting & layout. There were a few issues in the first revision with radio types instead of checkboxes.  

**Thoughts**: Looking back through the coe after a day of not working on it makes it difficult to interpret the work. I am sure clarity will ocme with time.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
