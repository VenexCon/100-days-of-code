# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30th 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Created a Github account, created a profile on freecode camp and completed 30% of the Responsive web design course. 

**Thoughts:** I have had an idea for a H&S website for a while, so I am going to use this as a goal to assist in my learning of HTML & Javascript. I obtained a link to the digital versions of YDNJS series. So far so good. 


### Day 1: January 2nd 2021

Worked on a project website for H&S question and answer. Attempted to mimic the HTML requirements form the respnsive web development course with random sucess, need to learn baout formatting & layout. There were a few issues in the first revision with radio types instead of checkboxes.  

**Thoughts**: Looking back through the coe after a day of not working on it makes it difficult to interpret the work. I am sure clarity will ocme with time. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 2: January 4th Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, along with integrating the learnt CSS & HTML works onto my SHEQ project. Learnt about style blocks, github projects and assigning classes. Researched into the use of commas and apostraphes, along with buying HTML & CSS design by Jon Duckett. 

**Thoughts** Great fun when working through bugs, or errors, learning how to use google and stack overflow is helping, along with watching some intro videos to CSS, HTML5 and github has helped progression. 

Things to research: ODIN project, Colt Steeles course, you don't know JS, Havard CS50.

### Day 3: January 6th Thursday.
Started listening to HTML series online. Continued with freecode camp. Learnt abouty using CSS to style boxes, padding, mrgins and using clockwork form to dictate top, right, bottom and left sizes. Trying to keep a seprate log on the individual elements and classes, but having discovered WS3Schools and other web resoruces it may prove more difficult to remember, so googling may be the way foward. 

CSS Lengths: can be absoloute such as inchs,mm, metres, or relative such as .em, or .rem. em & rem are relative units and therefore relative to fot sizes etc. 
Using the # signifies an element with a specific ID attribute, where as (.) signifiesa and element with a specific class attribute. 

### Day 4: January 8th Thursday.

Continued with free code camp, learnt about using CSS variables and custom variables and how the :root: function allows cascading.inheitance of attributes and takes priority above the body class. 
Also learnt was the use of ID''s to override certain CSS assignments along with using in-line styles. The use of RGB and Hex colours in CSS to give a bigger range of formatting colours. Also learnt about the use of assigning cutom variables to styles and elements. 

### Day 5: January 17th Monday 

Book from Jon Duckett came, reading into beginning of HTML and CSS. Including how to uise and arrange file structures within webpages. Also learnt was the use of building web pages in macs and how HTML works when working with websites such as wordpress and word documents. Also delve more deeply into using Aref's to navigate along pages. 
- Freecode camp is now onto applied visual Design, currently building the director on Github for the SHEQ website Q&A including a seperate page for questions already asked. 
- Looking in applied visual design and using properties to assign visual affects. Must remmeber that the (#) is for assigning properties. 


## Day 6: January 18th Tuesday. 
Began using "font-size and Font-weight properties with CSS. This can be used to aid in styling design for your webpage by adding in CSS to the html elements. 
Begin with Harvard CS:50. 
Introduction to using Psuedo-elements such as ":hover". 
Also learnng is about CSS Box model and containers, "Relative" means that you are moving an item relative to it's position on the normal flow of a page. This is contrary to absoloute, which locks an item to a fixed position and ccauses other items to ignore it and the space it fills. 
Also looked at was fixed positioning and how items can be fixed relative to it's parent's position. 

## Day 7 January 19th 
Applied web design and learning about display: block and in-line block elements, also learning about HSL and it's use for colour web design. Alos looked at was adding in Z-index to div elements to create the layering effect, the higher the Z number the further along the Z-axis it becomes. Learnt was using the Margin: auto; to center objects horizontaly on the webpage. 

## Day 8 January 20th
Day 8 begins with thelinear-repeating-gradiant(), where the gradient beginnings are written as the amount of pixels away from the start of the gradient. Also used was the use of psueod elements such as :hover, when used with eleemnts such as (div) and links. Using the Transform fuinction, along with the skew(X,Y,Z) for page design. 
Also shown was the use of background textures and patterns to aid in the visual layout ofd the site. 


## Day 9 Febuary 5th 
Day 9 begins after a two week break. Decided to spend some time renewing the SHEQ website with stuff learnt over the past couple of weeks rather than trying to burn myself out by hammering home freecodecamp.

## Day 10 Febuary 6th
Decided to add a navigation bar to the top of the SHEQ website, found out that using @import is now frowened upon so stopped attempting to make it work. Aftert he Nav bar isifnishedi  nthe demo HTML ill add the styles to a seperate CSS sheet to tdiy everything up. Currently using elements of freecodecamp such as creating links insides unordered lists to create a nvigation bar, along with using fixed positioning for the header. following https://codetheweb.blog/style-a-navigation-bar-css/

I asked a question on stack overflow and got some...heated responses, soft skills seem to be lacking in the developer world. I need to better utilise more up to date functions,and ensure that before using free-code-camp soloutions, to check if their are more up to date, or common methods.  

## Day 11 Febuary 7th 
Decided to carry on with freecode camp, although i still want to get a better grasp of CSS where possible. Before carrying on with freecode camp i want to get the DIV background width =100% and center the wording and submission form. Decided against the background color as it did not look right. 

Almost completed the Visual design element to Freecode camp and I am looking foward to getting started with the javascript element. I still want to get a good handle on CSS abd the underlying code and reasoning, but unsure of how to begin. The last elements are to do with UI design andf layout and @keyframes. 

## Day 12 Febuary 8th 

Today is focused on applied accessibility for user interfaces and how screen readers process information. Also instilled is the need to use the <hx> tags not for sizing, but for actual layout of the webpage and the flow, and to indicatet hier rank, not to automatically decide on sizings for you. You should aim to use CSS for this. 
  
   main, header, footer, nav, article, and section are all new HTML tags for HTML5
  Article = forum posts, news articles, and standalone content from the background webpages. 
  Section = Grouping thematically linked content together.
  
  <form>  
  <label for="name">Name:</label> ------------------> The "label for" value, must be equal to the ID of the element. 
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>
Also must remmeber HTML5 tags are <></> atrtributes sit inside tags, values are well values.
  
When looking into website accessibility, it is important to think about all aspects from colorblindess to just keyboard users for instancem, <div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div> can be used to rank tabs and priority. 

  ## Day 13 10th Febuary 2022
  
  Carrying on with free code camp, pretty happy with the main website frontpage but want to format the questions asked section to include up to date questions with answers, no idea how to do this yet but ui need to design the following; 
  - Question asked section 
  - Login for users
  - Profile pictures 
  - Accrediation upload for verification 
  - Verification for approved users 
  - Comments section to type up answers, that then appears below the asked question. 
  - A page that links to another page with comments 
...............i need to rebuild reddit........

  Continuing with the freecodce camp, i need to learn about viewports widths and differences to be able to appropriately assign the webpage to mobile, i need to go through and replace PX with EM equivilents and test it on mobile. 
  
  ## Day 14 12th Febuary 2022 
  
  I researched how to progress from FCC and looking at reddi it seems that the odin project would be a better move after finishing CSS flrexbox, although I am tempted to continue tpo obtain the certification with FC. 
To finish the Index.html page I stylised the links using CSS Flex to avoid using inline styles and contained these with a flex container (Ex-list). Thewse are now styled and i am finished with the front page for now. 
  
  
## Day 15 13th Febuary 2022 
  
Continued on with the freecodecamp flexbox section, along with signing up for the odin project. Will look into the Jon Duckett JS book once complete. 
  
  
 ## Day 16 17th Febuary 2022
  
  Continued learning about CSS Flex along with it's uses. Started with CSS Grid and introducing why to usae flex-basis. Spent time learning about the differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex. 
  
 ## Day 17 28th February 2022
  
  Began learning about CSS Grid and howand where to implement Grid vs Flex. I have now completed all the CSS lessons and subsequnetly have moved onto the projects section. I shall complete the projects but look to ammend the content to a more relevant discipline. I am also going to change the kayout of my website to encorportate CSS grid and then choose the most appropriate. 
  
  I have completed FreeCodeCamps project 1 on creating a tribute poage with 10/10 passes, this took me roughly 2-3 hours to finish with all tests passed. 

## Day 18 1st March 2022 
 Began completeing the survey page challenege on FreeCodeCamp. This will and shall be used on the Q&A website. 
  
  ## Day 19 2nd MArch 2022 
  
  Carried on with the code pen and finished the tribute page, began the survey page and completedt his evening. I changed the answered questions section to a CSS:grid format vs a flex box for easier manipulkation. Watched a few tutorials on how to create a forum so shall carry on with this and possible scrap the answered questions page. 
  
  ## Day 20 3rd MArch 2022 
  
 Completed the survey page and began working on adapting the website. Will make the landing page and then include the SHEQ website onto that. I completedt he survey page and integrated that into the website. I forked a seperate branch to test out the CSS:grid use for the answered questions. Also receivied the book relating to javascript and Jquery. 
  
 ## Day 21 4th MArch 2022 ## 
  
  Completed the survey page to a decent standard, began the product landing page. Utilising CSS Grid and Flex for certain elements. Grid is currently proving far more useful thean flex, but flex is useful for media quiries. Created a branch from the main SHEQ branch in order to verify the CSS grid use on the SHEQ topics page. 
  
 ## Day 22 5th MArch 2022 ## 
  
  Completed the product landing page and used the current ongoing support for Ukraine for inspiration, couldnt upload the images due ot limitations from Code-pen but managed to layout the page how i wanted it. Utilising free-code-camp lessons along with the HTML & CSS book from Jon Duckett. Began reading through the ABC's of Javascript programming and have begun to learn about JavaScript. 
  
  Currently realising that my webpages do seem to be quite samey, so going to attempt to find inspiration with the SHEQ website and begin getting comfrtable with images. Perhaps make a photogrpahy website. 
  
 ## Day 5-8th of MArch ## 
  
  Began learning the basics of JavaScript, using FreeCodeCamp and The odin project. I began reading through jon Ducketts work, but have been advised that it is better to learn up to JQuery, and then carry on with vanilla JS and touch upon JQuery later, as 80% of websites still use the JQuery Code. 
  
  I have decided to use TOP to stamp my progress, and use the FCC exercises to practice the taught elements. I have set-up Git, and have learnt that my past git commits are utter crap.
  
  To continue with the CSS & HTML practice, I am going to build a rental website for a holiday home, and try and implement everything i have learnt os far, including mobile first. Began going through the odin project JS fundamentals with Jon ducketts book as a subsidy, i still want to develop my html and CSS skills, hence the website design that i shall start on weekends. I have been watching videos on semantic html so I shall attempt to implement this. 
  
  To-do List 
  
  - Initial HTML for rental website, view other websites for inspiration. 
  - Create project files and commit to git, only allowed to use Gitbash for commits. 
  - Implement two scripts to make the website interactive, i.e greetings message or other interactivity. 
  
  
## Days 8-12th March. 
  
  Began with the foundations of javaScript, spending alot of time ensuring clean coding and getting familiar with console.log. Currently following the odin project, and using FCC resources to ensure that i practice with the theory. Got familiar with using Git and GitBash etc, still prefer Github but hey ho. I have began noting dfown uses for the JS Functions created and seeing how they are used in websites. 
  
Decided to not go for the holiday cottage, but rather the sanalogue photography website, i am going to embed some instas into the pages, as aprt of a feature and look into how i can use JS in a webpage. 

  
## Days 12th-24th March
  
 Contiunued with the JS Foundations course, alongside following the reading material supplied by the odin project. Completed all the JS challeneges so far without too much difficulty. The Golf Code, one i was worried about but managed to complete that in less than an hour. I have began using codePen to ensure that where I am not fully grasping the JavaScript, that i can take the functions and play around with them to ensure muscle memory. I made a password acceptor yesterday that took a string and identified lengths, and was passed through some if-else statements to show accepted or not accepted. 
<hr>
## Days 14th to the 28th March 2022. 
  
  For the past 12 days I have carried n learning JS but not referenced the books by Jon Duckett as much. The past JS lessons have focused on data manipulation by use of for, while and do while loops. I have been focusing on going back over the reference material as some things do not seem to be sinking in. I still have yet to include any JS in my code as i have not covered grabbing elements from the dom yet, so i have a few back-up ideas, so when i do learn, i can complete two projects. 
 
## Days 24th to 1st April.

This time has been spent focusing on the fCC exercises and MDN docs. Specifically learning about arrays, functions and recursion.
Time spent going through the TOP array sections and focusing on practicing with arrays in codePen. Currently onto the remove string exercises and I am beginning to find that syntax, and breaking down problems is becoming easier. 
Work has been incredibly busy so I have not been finding as much time during the week to learn, and as such progress has slowed.
